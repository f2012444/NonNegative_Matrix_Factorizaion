# NonNegative_Matrix_Factorizaion
My implementation of Non negative matrix factorization on Face dataset 


This is an implementation of NMF on the ORL face dataset using L1 or L2 distance. 

NMF.py file has the entire code. It is basic and easy to understand. 

Run NMF with the parameters to see how it works.
